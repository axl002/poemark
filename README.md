Poe Mark provides alerts when new items enter the market in the game Path of Exile. Users can subscribe to update feeds of particular types of items (ie. Windripper Imperial Bow) and receive a feed of updates as these items are put on the market at a low price. The low price is determined by computing the historic mean and standard deviation of the item's price.
